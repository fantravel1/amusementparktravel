# Nagashima Spa Land: The Complete 2025 Guide

**Nagashima Spa Land is Japan's most underrated theme park** — while tourists flock to Fuji-Q and Tokyo Disney, coaster enthusiasts know this park near Nagoya delivers one of the world's best coaster collections combined with authentic Japanese hot springs.

## Why Nagashima Deserves Your Attention

This isn't a tourist park — it's where Japanese families and coaster fans go for serious rides. The combination of Steel Dragon 2000 (one of the world's longest coasters) and Hakugei (an RMC masterpiece) makes this a global destination that most Western visitors miss entirely.

**Key Stats:**
- **Steel Dragon 2000** — Among world's longest coasters
- **Hakugei** — Asia's only RMC hybrid coaster
- **Adjacent hot springs** — Soak after riding
