## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it compare to SeaWorld?
Much larger aquarium, similar animal shows, better coasters. The Ocean Wonder tank alone exceeds anything SeaWorld offers in scale.

### Is it ethical?
Complex question. Marine parks globally face criticism. Chimelong has conservation programs but also animal performances. Research and decide personally.

### Hong Kong or Chimelong?
Chimelong Ocean Kingdom beats Ocean Park for scale and modern attractions. Ocean Park has better Hong Kong integration and accessibility.

### Can I combine with Macau?
Perfect combo. Stay at Chimelong resort, visit Macau casinos and heritage sites. Natural pairing given proximity.

### One day enough?
Possible but rushed. Two days allows full appreciation of both marine life and rides without exhaustion.

Chimelong Ocean Kingdom represents Chinese theme park ambitions realized. The aquarium alone justifies the visit — nothing else on Earth matches its scale. Combined with legitimate thrill rides and resort facilities, it's a destination that belongs on global theme park bucket lists.
