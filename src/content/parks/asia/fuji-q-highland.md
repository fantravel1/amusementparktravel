## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are the coasters really that extreme?
Yes. Eejanaika and Do-Dodonpa are among the most intense in the world. Takabisha's drop is genuinely terrifying. These are not exaggerations.

### Is it worth visiting if coasters might be closed?
Check the website before going. If your must-rides are operational, absolutely. If key rides are down, consider rescheduling.

### Can I see Mount Fuji?
On clear days, spectacularly yes. Fujiyama coaster especially offers incredible views. Winter months have best visibility.

### How does it compare to other Japan parks?
Different purpose. DisneySea for beauty and immersion, Fuji-Q for extreme thrills. Universal for IP. They complement rather than compete.

Fuji-Q Highland is for coaster enthusiasts who want to test their limits against some of the world's most extreme rides, all with Japan's most sacred mountain as witness. It's not polished, it's not always reliable, but when everything's running, it's unforgettable.
