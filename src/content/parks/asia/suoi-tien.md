Generally yes, though use normal precautions. Rides are older but functional. Stay aware of your belongings.

### Is it worth visiting?
If you want unique experiences, absolutely. If you want polished theme park entertainment, look elsewhere.

### Is it offensive to Buddhists?
Vietnamese Buddhism is quite different from Western perceptions. Locals enjoy the park without religious concerns. Respect is appreciated but casual enjoyment is normal.

### How long should I spend?
3-5 hours is sufficient to see highlights. Full day if doing water park.

Suoi Tien isn't for everyone, but for travelers seeking genuine uniqueness, it's a treasure. The combination of Buddhist mythology, Vietnamese kitsch, crocodiles, and amusement park creates something that simply doesn't exist anywhere else on Earth.
