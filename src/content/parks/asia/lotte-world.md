## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it compare to Everland?
Everland (Korea's other major park) is larger with better coasters. Lotte World is indoor, convenient (in Seoul), and better for bad weather or time-limited visits.

### Is it worth it for adults?
Mixed. Families and K-culture enthusiasts will enjoy it. Coaster enthusiasts may find it limited. The experience is charming but not thrilling.

### How many hours needed?
4-6 hours covers everything. Full day if you're thorough and including Lotte Tower.

### Can I combine with Lotte Tower?
Yes — combination tickets available. Tower adds 1-2 hours.

Lotte World offers a unique Seoul experience — theme park entertainment accessible by subway, immune to weather, and quintessentially Korean. It's not a destination park but an excellent Seoul activity.
