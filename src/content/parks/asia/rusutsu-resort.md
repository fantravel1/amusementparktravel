## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it worth visiting just for the park?
For coaster counters and scenic travelers, yes. For pure thrill seekers expecting mega-park intensity, temper expectations. The setting elevates the experience significantly.

### How does it compare to mainland Japan parks?
Smaller coaster collection but unique atmosphere. The Hokkaido mountain setting isn't replicated anywhere else. Different experience rather than competing experience.

### Can I ski and ride coasters?
Not same trip — different seasons. Ski: December-March. Theme park: May-October. Some overlap possible in shoulder seasons.

### Is one day enough?
Easily. The park itself can be done in half a day. Combine with resort activities, hiking, or use as part of Hokkaido road trip.

### Best way to include in Japan trip?
Part of Hokkaido itinerary. Fly into Sapporo, explore Hokkaido (Rusutsu, Niseko, Otaru, Furano), fly out. Adds unique dimension to typical Japan trip.

Rusutsu Resort won't compete with Japan's major parks for coaster quantity or intensity, but it offers something none of them can: world-class mountain scenery, fresh Hokkaido air, and a peaceful alternative to crowded urban parks. For travelers seeking Japan beyond the obvious, it's a memorable discovery.
