## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it compare to Europa-Park?
Fewer rides overall but excellent top coasters. Better weather, beach nearby. Less theming depth but still good. Significantly cheaper.

### Is Ferrari Land worth the extra cost?
For coaster enthusiasts, Red Force alone is worth it. Otherwise, 2-3 hours is enough — combo ticket makes sense for one visit.

### Can I combine with a beach holiday?
Perfect combination! Salou beaches are minutes away. Many visitors do 2-3 park days plus beach time.

### How many days needed?
Two days for PortAventura Park thoroughly. Add half day for Ferrari Land. Water park is a separate day.

PortAventura World delivers Spanish sun, world-class coasters, and genuine resort atmosphere. Combined with nearby beaches, it's an unbeatable Mediterranean holiday.
