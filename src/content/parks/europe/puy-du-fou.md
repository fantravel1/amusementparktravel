## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to speak French?
Shows are visual enough to enjoy without fluency. Historical context helps but isn't essential. Signs and menus have some English.

### Is it good for children?
Excellent for ages 5+. Shows are dramatic but not scary. Younger children may find length challenging.

### Really no rides?
Correct. A few gentle attractions exist, but this park is about shows. If you need coasters, this isn't for you. If you want spectacle, nothing compares.

### How does it rank against Disney?
Different experiences. Disney offers rides and IP characters. Puy du Fou offers unmatched live entertainment. Many prefer Puy du Fou for emotional impact and uniqueness.

### Is two days really necessary?
Yes. Shows overlap significantly. One day means missing several major experiences.

Puy du Fou proves that theme parks can be art. The commitment to historical accuracy, the scale of productions, and the emotional storytelling create something unique in the world. Come for the shows, leave with memories that rival any coaster.
