It's showing its age (Arrow rough patches) but the iconic status and views make it worth riding. Icon is the superior modern experience.

### Is one day enough?
Easily. The park's compact size means you can ride everything in a day. Add time for Valhalla queue and re-rides.

### Should I do the whole Blackpool experience?
If you've traveled there, absolutely. The Tower, illuminations, seafront, and fish & chips are part of British culture. Make it a full day trip.
