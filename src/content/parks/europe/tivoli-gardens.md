## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it worth it just for atmosphere?
Absolutely. Many visitors enjoy Tivoli without riding anything. The gardens, dining, and evening atmosphere are the real attractions.

### Best time of year?
Christmas season is most magical but crowded. Summer offers full operations and concerts. Each season has unique charm.

### Is it too small?
At 20 acres, it's compact. But size isn't the point — atmosphere is. Quality over quantity.

### Good for thrill seekers?
Limited. The Demon is solid, but this isn't a thrill park. Come for the experience, not the coasters.

### Can I combine with other Copenhagen activities?
Perfect for it. Central location means easy combination with Nyhavn, museums, etc.

Tivoli Gardens proves that theme parks can be art. It's not competing with Cedar Point or Disney — it's something entirely different and equally valuable. A Copenhagen essential.
