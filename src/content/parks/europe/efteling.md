## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Efteling compare to Disneyland Paris?
Different vibes. Efteling is more atmospheric and traditional, less commercial feeling. Fewer "big" rides but superior dark rides and theming depth. Significantly cheaper. Both are worth visiting.

### Is it worth visiting in winter?
Absolutely. Winter Efteling is spectacular with fire, lights, and magical atmosphere. Fewer rides operate but the experience is unforgettable.

### Is it too kiddie for adults?
Not at all. Baron 1898, Symbolica, and the overall atmosphere delight adults. It's a park for families but not just for children.

### Can I do it in one day?
Yes, comfortably — especially in off-peak times. The park is large but manageable. Two days allows for re-rides and relaxed exploration.

Efteling represents theme park magic at its purest — a place where fairytales feel real and every detail serves the story. It's not trying to be Disney; it's being something equally wonderful and entirely its own.
