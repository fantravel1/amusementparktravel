## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does SeaWorld compare to Disney/Universal?
Different experience. Better coasters than Magic Kingdom or Hollywood Studios. Less immersive theming than Disney. Animal focus provides unique value. Generally lower crowds and prices.

### Is one day enough?
Yes, comfortably. The park is compact and efficient.

### Are the animal shows ethical?
SeaWorld has evolved significantly. Orca breeding ended in 2016. Focus shifted to education, rescue, and rehabilitation. Each guest can decide their comfort level.

SeaWorld Orlando offers a compelling Orlando alternative — genuine thrills, meaningful animal encounters, and typically lower crowds than the Disney/Universal juggernaut.
