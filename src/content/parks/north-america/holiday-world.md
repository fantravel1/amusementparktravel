# Holiday World: The Complete 2025 Guide

**It's 10 PM. The woods are black. The Voyage launches into darkness — 6,442 feet of wooden coaster you can't see coming. Airtime. Airtime. Airtime. You're screaming, laughing, questioning reality. When it ends, you walk to the Pepsi station, fill a free cup, and get back in line.** This is Holiday World — the family-owned park that treats you like family while delivering world-class terror.

## 🎅 The Park That Shouldn't Exist

### The Business Model Makes No Sense

| What Other Parks Do | What Holiday World Does |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Charge $30 for parking | **FREE parking** |
| Charge $5-8 per drink | **FREE unlimited drinks** |
| Nickel-and-dime everything | **Free sunscreen, free Wi-Fi** |
| Corporate ownership | **Family-owned since 1946** |
| Adequate coasters | **World-class Voyage + Thunderbird** |

**The Result:** 4.8 star average. Fanatical guest loyalty. Proof that kindness and world-class attractions aren't mutually exclusive.

## 🔥 2025: Why This Year

- **The Voyage maintenance** — Recent track work keeping it elite
- **Perfect Midwestern summer** — July-August optimal

### The Night Ride Window

**The Voyage at night is a religious experience.** Not metaphor. Enthusiasts describe it in spiritual terms. 2025 summer means extended hours and maximum night ride opportunities.

## 🚀 The Voyage: Why Enthusiasts Make Pilgrimages

### The Statistics

### The Experience

**Daytime:** You see glimpses — trees rushing past, track appearing ahead, moments of weightlessness stacking relentlessly.

**The Moment Everyone Remembers:** The triple-down. Three consecutive drops in darkness. Your stomach relocates permanently.

### Why Night Rides Matter
