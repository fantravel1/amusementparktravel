Excellent. Mammoth and Wildebeest are legitimate world-class water attractions. It's a full water park, not an afterthought.

### How do free drinks work?
Stations throughout both parks. Cups provided. Walk up, fill, repeat. Unlimited. They trust guests not to abuse it — and guests don't.

### Worth the drive from [major city]?
For coaster enthusiasts, absolutely. The Voyage alone justifies 3-4 hour drives. Combine with nearby French Lick or Louisville for a trip.
