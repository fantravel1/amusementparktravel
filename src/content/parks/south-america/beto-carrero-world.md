Yes! While primarily a Brazilian destination, international visitors find excellent value, unique attractions, and a glimpse into Brazilian entertainment culture. The Hot Wheels area and live shows are world-class.

### How does it compare to Disney World?
Different experiences. Beto Carrero offers great value, unique Brazilian flavor, and excellent live shows, but lacks Disney's IP depth and technological sophistication. At 1/4 the price, it's an excellent alternative for value-conscious travelers.

### Do I need to speak Portuguese?
Not essential but helpful. Staff at main guest services speak some English. The app and signage are increasingly bilingual. Having basic Portuguese phrases helps.
